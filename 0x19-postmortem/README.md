 Issue Summary:
 Duration: 
   Start Time: March 14, 2024, 10:00 AM EDT
   End Time: March 14, 2024, 2:00 PM EDT
 Impact:
   The core web application experienced intermittent downtime, with services being inaccessible for approximately 30% of our global users.
 Root Cause:
   A misconfiguration in the load balancer caused excessive traffic redirection, leading to service degradation and eventual downtime.

 Timeline:
 10:00 AM EDT: Issue Detected
   Monitoring alerts flagged unusual spikes in traffic.
 10:15 AM EDT: Initial Investigation
   Engaged the DevOps team to investigate potential issues in the load balancer configurations.
 11:00 AM EDT: Assumptions Made
   Initial assumption: A surge in legitimate user traffic might be overwhelming the load balancer.
 11:30 AM EDT: Misleading Investigation Paths
   Investigated backend services for possible bottlenecks, wasting valuable time.
 12:00 PM EDT: Escalation
   Escalated the incident to the network engineering team as load balancer misconfiguration suspicions grew.
 1:30 PM EDT: Issue Resolution
   Identified and rectified misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
 2:00 PM EDT: Service Restoration
   Services were gradually restored to full functionality as load balancing returned to normal.

 Root Cause and Resolution:
 Root Cause:
   Misconfiguration in load balancer settings led to improper traffic distribution, causing service degradation and intermittent downtime.
 Resolution:
   Load balancer settings were adjusted to ensure proper traffic distribution and prevent recurrence of the issue.

 Corrective and Preventative Measures:
 Improvements/Fixes:
   Implement automated load balancer configuration validation to catch misconfigurations early.
   Enhance monitoring to detect abnormal traffic patterns more effectively.
 Tasks:
   Patch load balancer configuration scripts to enforce best practices.
